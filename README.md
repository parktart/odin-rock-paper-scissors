# odin-rock-paper-scissors

A simple JavaScript program for rock paper scissors.

The first JavaScript project in the Odin curriculum! Super excited to start coding some JavaScript after completing the *thorough* intro to JS by The Odin Project.

The program will be **vanilla** without any frameworks or additional libraries. 

JavaScript lessons and fundamentals I hope to utilize:

- Adding JS to HTML
- Variables
- Numbers
- Operators
- Data Types
- Comparisons == != > <
- Conditionals - if else switch ?
- Logical Operators || $$ !
- DevTools Debugging
- Functions
- Problem-Solving
- Pseudocode
- Errors

Let's go!



<u>Final Thoughts</u>:

Completing a vanilla JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors project proved to be a great learning experience! I know there are probably dozens of examples online but I did avoid looking at them as I wanted a chance to strengthen my problem-solving skills while using JavaScript syntax. I'm excited to check those solutions and examples now to see how others structured the logic and, probably, how much shorter my code could have been :)

Structuring the logic for the game was actually not the hardest part as I think I spent more time on the CSS! I'm thinking this means it was good practice in making JavaScript interact with HTML and CSS to create a dynamic page. Overall, the project provided a well-rounded experience in web dev, and I feel a sense of accomplishment from creating a working application from scratch.



I'm stopping here and leaving the following tweaks for another day..

- try changing setTimeout() to Event Listeners of type "transitionend"
- does it look better without the white arena border?
- should body font-size be increased to 1.25rem?
