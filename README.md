# odin-rock-paper-scissors
A simple JavaScript program for rock paper scissors. 

The first JavaScript project in the the Odin curriculum! Super excited to start coding some JavaScript after completing the *thorough* intro to JS by The Odin Project.

JavaScript lessons and fundamentals I hope to utilize:
- Adding JS to HTML
- Variables
- Numbers
- Operators
- Data Types
- Comparisons == != > <
- Conditionals - if else switch ?
- Logical Operators || $$ !
- DevTools Debugging
- Functions
- Problem Solving
- Pseudocode
- Errors

Lets go!
